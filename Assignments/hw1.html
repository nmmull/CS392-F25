In this assignment we'll be looking at two classic mathematical
conjectures, one of which is unsolved and one of which has been
disproved, and both of which have a history of people trying to verify
them with computers.  The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate
that it's quite easy to write and optimize fast math verification code
in Rust (no more rooting around in C or C++).  Generally speaking,
I'll try to design assignments in this way: if you just want a bit of
practice, that's all you need to do, but if you want a challege, it'll
be there too.
</p>

<p>
This assignment due <b>Thursday 9/11 by 8:00 PM</b>. You'll need to submit
a <code>.zip</code> file containing a Cargo project named <code>hw1</code> in
Gradescope. You can get the setup with:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-nil">cargo new hw1
</pre>
</div>
<p>
You'll put all your solutions into the file <code>hw1/src/main.rs</code>.  Please
make sure to run <code>cargo clean</code> before submitting, i.e., don't sumbit the <code>_build</code> directory.
</p>
<div id="outline-container-orgd18de04" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgd18de04"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> Collatz Conjecture</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
The Collatz conjecture asks if, for any positive integer \(n\), the
following procedure eventually halts:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>if \(n\) is \(1\), then <b>HALT</b>;</li>
<li>if \(n\) is even, divide \(n\) by \(2\);</li>
<li>if \(n\) is odd, multiple \(n\) by \(3\) and add \(1\).</li>
</ul>

<p>
Implementing this procedure has become a kind of FizzBuzz test when
learning a new PL.  To make it <i>just a bit</i> more interesting,
implement the function <code>verify_collatz</code> which, given a number <code>hi</code> of
type <code>usize</code>, verifies that the conjecture holds for every number up
to and including <code>hi</code>.  The function should not return anything, but
you may want to include some print statements for your own benefit.
Note that this function may not halt if the conjecture is false!
</p>

<p>
Determine a value of <code>hi</code> so that your implementation runs for a
reasonable amount of time (let's say 5 minutes).  How high can your
implementation go?
</p>

<p>
<i>Note:</i> Make sure to run using <code>cargo run --release</code> to get full speed.

<h2 id="orgd773bbd"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> Pólya Conjecture</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
The Pólya conjecture, in rough terms, asks if, for any positive
integer \(n\) greater than \(1\), at least half of all positive integers
at most \(n\) have an odd number of prime factors (This has surprising
connection to the Riemann hypothesis).
</p>

<p>
More formally, define \(\Omega : \mathbb N^+ \to \mathbb N\) so that
\(\Omega(n)\) is the number of prime factors of \(n\) counting
multiplicites.  For example, \(\Omega(18) = 3\) since \(18 = 2 * 3 *
3\). Define \(\lambda : \mathbb N^+ \to \{-1, 1\}\) as
</p>

\begin{align*}
\lambda(n) = (-1)^{\Omega(n)}
\end{align*}

<p>
and \(L : \mathbb N^+ \to \mathbb Z\) as
</p>

\begin{align*}
L(n) = \sum_{i = 1}^n \lambda(n)
\end{align*}

<p>
Note that \(L(n) \leq 0\) if and only if at least half of all positive
integers at most \(n\) have an odd number of prime factors.
</p>

<p>
The Pólya conjecture has been disproved, and the smallest
counterexample is just shy of a billion: \(906,150,257\).  When this
number was found, it required some serious compute to verify.  Our
goal is to verify it on our laptops with a couple lines of code.
</p>

<p>
Implement the function <code>verify_polya</code> which, given a number <code>hi</code> of
type <code>usize</code>, verifies the conjecture up to and including <code>hi</code>.  The
function should not return anything, but should stop if it finds a
counterexample (and print it).
</p>

<p>
Find a value of <code>hi</code> so that your implementation runs for a reasonable
amount of time (let's say 5 minutes).  How high can your
implementation go?

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
<b>(Optional)</b> In the previous question you're not required to verify
the minimal counterexample.  The naïve solution likely won't be able
to do this.  <i>The challenge:</i> try to make your implementation in the
previous problem as fast as possible.  A couple things to try:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Make sure you're cutting out any unnecessary computations of
\(\Omega\).</li>
<li>Compute prime numbers while computing \(\Omega\) and use those for
later computations of the values of \(\Omega\) (you may want to look
up <code>Vec</code> if you're interested in trying this).</li>
<li>If you just want to verify the smallest counterexample, be careful
about your choice of number types.</li>
<li>Use a crate like <code>slow_primes</code> to help you with prime number
calculations.</li>
<li>Use a crate like <code>bit_vec</code> to store \(\lambda\) in a bit vector.</li>
</ul>

<p>
My implementation runs in about 100s on my laptop.  Once you've
optimized, have fun with other side-quests:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Dealing with integer overflow (note that integer
overflow is <i>not</i> checked at runtime in release mode).</li>
<li>Determine how many counter examples there are below a billion.</li>
<li>Determine the largest value of \(L\) below a billion.</li>
</ul>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
<b>(Double Optional)</b> As in the previous problem, the naïve
implementation of <code>verify_collatz</code> won't get you that far.  But there
are a lot of optimizations which can be done to make the code
faster. In fact, a paper came out <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11227-025-07337-0.pdf">this year</a> which gives improved
verification algorithms for Collatz.  <i>The challenge:</i> make your
implementation of the first problem as fast as possible.  If you want
a target, take a look at <a href="https://pcbarina.fit.vutbr.cz/path-records.htm">this table</a> and the definition of a <i>path
record</i>. How high of a path record can you verify on your laptop? My
not-terribly-optimized solution only gets me to about \(50\) in 5
minutes.
